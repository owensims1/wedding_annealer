# wedding_annealer
Using simulated annealing to determine an optimal seating arrangement for my sister's wedding.

Will run compatibility on a number of TBD attributes of each guest.

Run: 
```
ruby annealer.rb
```

Potential curveball rules:
- Lesa can only sit next to single guys
- Jamie has to sit in the corner.
